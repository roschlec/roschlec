title: "Fluorescent Protein Expression as a Proxy for Bacterial Fitness in a High-Throughput Assay"

abstract: "Bacterial growth is classically assessed by measuring the increases in optical density of pure cultures in shaken liquid media. Measuring growth using optical density has severe limitations when studying multistrain interactions, as it is not possible to measure the growth of individual strains within mixed cultures. Here, we demonstrated that constitutively expressed fluorescent proteins can be used to track the growth of individual strains in different liquid media. Fluorescence measurements were highly correlated with optical density measurements and cell counts. This allowed us to assess bacterial growth not only in pure cultures but also in mixed bacterial cultures and determine the impact of a competitor on a focal strain, thereby assessing relative fitness. Furthermore, we were able to track the growth of two different strains simultaneously by using fluorescent proteins with differential excitation and emission wavelengths. Bacterial densities measured by fluorescence yielded more consistent data between technical replicates than optical density measurements. Our setup employs fluorescence microplate readers that allow high throughput and replication."
