title: "Driving factors of epiphytic bacterial communities: A review"

abstract: "Bacteria establish complex, compositionally consistent communities on healthy leaves. Ecological processes such as dispersal, diversification, ecological drift, and selection as well as leaf surface physicochemistry and topology impact community assembly. Since the leaf surface is an oligotrophic environment, species interactions such as competition and cooperation may be major contributors to shape community structure. Furthermore, the plant immune system impacts on microbial community composition, as plant cells respond to bacterial molecules and shape their responses according to the mixture of molecules present. Such tunability of the plant immune network likely enables the plant host to differentiate between pathogenic and non-pathogenic colonisers, avoiding costly immune responses to non-pathogenic colonisers. Plant immune responses are either systemically distributed or locally confined, which in turn affects the colonisation pattern of the associated microbiota. However, how each of these factors impacts the bacterial community is unclear. To better understand this impact, bacterial communities need to be studied at a micrometre resolution, which is the scale that is relevant to the members of the community. Here, current insights into the driving factors influencing the assembly of leaf surface-colonising bacterial communities are discussed, with a special focus on plant host immunity as an emerging factor contributing to bacterial leaf colonisation."
