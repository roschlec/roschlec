Bacterial individuality can only be acknowledge at the single-cell level. To observe bacterial cells, we have developed a series of plasmids to tag them with unique fluorescent proteins. These plasmids are based on an expression, Tn5- and Tn7-delivery vectors. Check them out <a href = "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2018.03052/full" target="_blank">here!</a>. If you're interested in them, they're also available on <a href = "https://www.addgene.org/browse/article/28196767/" target="_blank">Addgene.org</a>

We keep improving on our abilities to modify non-model microorganisms through new methods and tools. I'm currently working on new tools based on a CRISPR system and different transposase genes.

Also, I'm involved in the development of bioreporters that would inform us on bacterial activity and physiology in the phyllosphere at the micrometre resolution.
