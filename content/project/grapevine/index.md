During my BSc and MSc, I was involved in different projects related to grapevine biology. Being part of the Consorcio Tecnológico de la Fruta, I worked with  varieties of grapevine (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) resistant to the fungi <i>Erysiphe necator</i>. <i>E. necator</i> is the causal agent of the grapevine powdery mildew, heavily impacting on grapevine productivity in pre-harvest seasons. Using microsatellite-informed genetic breeding, we worked on the characterisation and the crossing of resistant genotypes to obtain varieties with added value for the table grape industry.

Side projects included the manual curation of a family of transcriptional regulators of the biosynthetic pathway of grapevine secondary metabolites --phenylpropanoids, including stilbenes and flavonoids--, the R2R3-MYB transcription factors. This work was in collaboration with <a href="https://tomsbiolab.com" target="_blank">Dr. José Tomás Matus </a>, currently PI at I2SysBio (Valencia, Spain).
